# Measurement descriptions LIBS - Prague 2016-08-23
The database and documentation of our samples measured in summer 2016 is given. The appropriate `.pdf` of possibly `.docx` text file covers the catalogization and photographic data for each groups of samples described.
This database was made by Libor Lenža and Barbora Gerogrová, whose rights are reserved. Despite being stored and shared via and open-source repository, the data are rather meant to be more privat for our research group.
