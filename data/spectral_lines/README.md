# Spectral lines
The data found according to the spectral lines investigated are given.
* First of all, the output of search at NIST.gov database are included. The ascii data files include the spectral lines parameters of some elements chosen in such a scale from 200 to 800 nanometers for the ablation spectra analysis and simulations.
