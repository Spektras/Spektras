# Ablation spectra
The files stored cover the ablation spectra data which have already been processed within the Meteor Master or possibly `mm_spectras.py`. 
* The `.xlsx` file of `mesosiderite_fit_analysis` includes the results of spectra fitting tools and the elementery elemental analysis of the mesosiderite (Jiddat al Harais 267) sample.
