The extra data measured and processed within the indirect meteoric detection by the method of SID monitors are given.
* The figures `Persei_radio_spectra.jpg` and `Persei_spectra.jpg` cover the spectra measured simultaneously within the meteoric radio reflection in the ionosphere. The radio spectral profile was reached directly from the measurement, the emission spectra are fitted.
* The OH- and nitrogen spectra stand as an output of a roughly simplified chemical model, which had been drawn to calculate the energy levels of such particles present in the ionosphere both in the basic state and after excitation (or possible ionization) caused to happen by the meteoric impact. The graphs were drawn using non-fitted meaused data. 
Within them, some strong spectral lines of iron and titanium were distinguished.
* The figures describing the relative plasma distribution (`Persei_plasma_distribution.jpg`) and an approximation of real 2D plasma geometry (`Persei.jpg`) are also given.
The source data are covered by the electron density and free electron temperature, which are both able to be provided by our measurement. 
* The free electron temperature was both measured (`Persei_temperature.jpg`) and simulated using a preliminary version of the script `https://github.com/Spektras/Spektras/blob/master/Spectra%20analysis%20and%20simulation/mm_tester.py`.

The data and computation results involved are saved via this repository as `-ascii` files named appropriately. The original input data will be added soon.
The calculations can be processed by both MATLAB and iPython languages.
