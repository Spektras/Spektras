# Atmospheric observations
The data processed within the atmospheric observations of meteors are given and stored.
* First of all, the file `Spectrograph_database.xlsx`, obligingly given by Mr Jakub Koukal, covers the database of meteoric showers observations within the optical spectrography.
* The script `meteoroid.py` covers the data analysis based on the indirect atmospheric observation provided by the SID method. Some examples of the results are given in the following folder; the code is up to be completed properly.
* Moreover, via the folder `20150812_232102 #007 PER`, the up to date results done within the indirect meteoric detection by the SID method (see http://wiki.ionozor.cz/doku.php?id=en:start) are stored. In the folder `NIR_spectra`, the correction of calling for NIR molecular spectra within the SID method is given.
Such results stand up to comparison with the spectrographic data and their discussion will have been solved as soon as possible.
