## Extra atmospheric observation data
This data cover the input files and output gaphs processed via the `meteoroid.py` script.
* The data files `electron_density.txt`, `Emission_electron_density.txt` and `Horizontal_flow.txt` are provided by the SID measurement,
while both ionoshperic and meteoric plasma paramteres are involved.
* The graphs are given as the final solution of the data processing, the cover the electron density distribution and the location of the meteoroid solid in 3D metrical space.
