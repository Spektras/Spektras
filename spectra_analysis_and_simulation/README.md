# Spectra analysis and simulation
Algorithms ans data being used for meteoric UV and visible spectra analysis and simulation are collected.
* The script `mm_tester.py` covers the drafts of ablation spectra analysis. The computations used allow us to get the approximation of the free electron temperature, the electron density and their relation to the spectral lines.
Moreover, a simpe model calculation of the plasma distribution is given. The parameters were set for a hypothetic meteoric impact characterized by the same physical properties reaching the atmosphere. The file of `input_one.txt`, the only input data insted of the ablation spectra, needs to be downloaded with the script.
